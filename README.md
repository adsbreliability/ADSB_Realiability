All the modules to process the data were written in python. In order to utilize them  you need to supply a csv file formatted according to each module.
The modules use other libraries that are built in python and some others you need to install them.

You need to install **geopy** and **pyModeS** libraries to run the code. 
Once you provide the module an input csv file, it will process it and store the result in a **Sqlite DB**.
